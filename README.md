## Personal Profile
Software Engineer focused on backend systems and integrations. Over the past year I have delivered several JavaScript/Node.js projects—building backend services, integrations and APIs—and implemented solutions based on AI and RAG. I focus on architecture first: design the system, then pick the tools.
My engineering approach is reinforced by 15+ years in project management and people development, where I implemented automation, streamlined processes and built data analytics tools. This combination helps me handle the technical detail and work effectively with people.
